# Love-lua-game

This repository contains a simple 2D platformer game built using the LÖVE (Love2D) game engine in Lua. LÖVE is a free, open-source framework that you can use to create 2D games in Lua. It provides access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics functionality through Lua.

## Prerequisites

To run the games and examples in this repository, you will need:

- LÖVE 11.3 or higher installed on your computer. You can download it from [Love2D.org](https://love2d.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-github/love-lua-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

   ```bash
   cd love-lua-game
   ```

3. Run the game using the LÖVE executable:

   ```bash
   love .
   ```

   Make sure that the path to the LÖVE executable is in your system's PATH.

## Game Description

The game is a simple 2D platformer where the player can jump and run across a series of platforms while avoiding obstacles.

### Features

- Player movement (left, right, and jump)
- Simple physics for jumping and falling
- Collision detection
- Scoring system

## Code Structure

The codebase is divided into several main parts:

- `main.lua` - Initializes the game and manages the game loop.
- `player.lua` - Handles player properties and behaviors.
- `world.lua` - Manages the game world, including platforms and obstacles.

### `main.lua`

```lua
function love.load()
    require "player"
    require "world"
    player.load()
    world.load()
end

function love.update(dt)
    player.update(dt)
    world.update(dt)
end

function love.draw()
    world.draw()
    player.draw()
end
```

### `player.lua`

```lua
player = {}
player.x = 100
player.y = 100
player.speed = 200
player.jumpHeight = -300
player.gravity = -500

function player.load()
    player.image = love.graphics.newImage("player.png")
end

function player.update(dt)
    if love.keyboard.isDown("right") then
        player.x = player.x + player.speed * dt
    elseif love.keyboard.isDown("left") then
        player.x = player.x - player.speed * dt
    end

    if love.keyboard.isDown("space") and player.y >= love.graphics.getHeight() - 50 then
        player.velocity = player.jumpHeight
    end

    player.y = player.y + player.velocity * dt
    player.velocity = player.velocity - player.gravity * dt

    if player.y > love.graphics.getHeight() - 50 then
        player.y = love.graphics.getHeight() - 50
    end
end

function player.draw()
    love.graphics.draw(player.image, player.x, player.y)
end
```

### `world.lua`

```lua
function world.load()
    -- Load world components here
end

function world.update(dt)
    -- Update world components here
end

function world.draw()
    -- Draw world components here
end
```
